# clarify
# example input:
# "(array = ][, object = {}, string = ''"
# "(x + [1, { a: 2, b: 3}])"
# expected output:
# false
# true

# visualize
# Write a function that takes in a string of code and counts how many open parenthesis are in the string
# Write a function that takes in a string of code and counts how many open parenthesis, curly bracets, and square brackets are in the string, as well as how many close parenthesis, curly bracets, and square brackets
