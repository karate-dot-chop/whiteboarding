# Write a function that takes in two strings and returns the longest common substring.

# clarify
# Input: 2 strings => "trend", "brenda"
# Output: string => "rend"

# Write a function that prints "hello"
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and print each string
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and loops through each and prints out each character
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and loops through the first string, then loops through the second string and compares each letter and prints "match!" if they match


# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array of the same numbers without any duplicates.

# clarify
# Input: array of nums => [1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 1, 6]
# Ouput: array of nums => [1, 3, 5, 2, 6]
